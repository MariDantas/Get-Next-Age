# Get Next Age

## Description
**Get Next Age** is a simple project that allows users to determine their age for the next year. The user can input their current age into the text box, which is then passed to the function ```getNextAge()```. This function returns the user's age + 1, which is displayed below the text box alongside the text "Next year, you will be". Additionally, users can easily increase and decrease their age in the text box using the arrow keys for convenience and quick adjustments.

## Executing the Project
As this project doesn't use the HTTP protocol and requires running on a local server due to the presence of modules, follow these steps for execution:
1. **Download and install Visual Studio Code:** If you don't have it already, download and install Visual Studio Code, a lightweight and powerful code editor available for multiple platforms.
2. **Install the "Live Server" extension:** In Visual Studio Code, click the gear icon and select "Extensions" from the dropdown menu. In the search box, type "Live Server" and select it from the search results to install the extension. This extension will be used to serve the project locally.
3. **Open the project folder:** After installing the "Live Server" extension, open Visual Studio Code and click the "Open Folder" button in the "Explorer" tab. Select the folder containing the "Get Next Age" project files.
4. **Start the local server:** In the bottom right corner of the Visual Studio Code window, locate the "Go Live" text and click it. This will start the local server and automatically open the project in your default web browser.
5. **Test and execute:** Your default web browser will display the "Get Next Age" application. Input your current age in the text box provided, and the application will instantly show your age for the next year below the text box.
6. **Adjust age using arrow keys:** You can conveniently increase or decrease your age in the text box by using the arrow keys, allowing for quick updates.
7. **Stop the server:** To stop the local server, simply click the same corner where the port number is now displayed. The server will terminate, and the application will no longer be accessible through the browser.

Visual Studio Code's "Live Server" feature acts as a local server, providing an easy way to execute and test applications without any complications. Although mainly intended for developers, it proves to be an interesting and useful tool for running this particular application.
